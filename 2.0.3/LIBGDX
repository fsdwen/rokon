Rokon 2 would not have been possible without the help of the libgdx project - http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/

libgdx is another Android game engine, with the unique ability to deploy your Android applications as regular desktop Java apps.

With the permission and assistance of Mario, the project creator, Rokon has utilised the NDK wrapper for Box2D written for libgdx.
 
 
Thanks!
