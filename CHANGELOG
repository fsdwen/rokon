2.0.3
	New Features
		* Drawable now has onTouch events within itself
		* DrawableObject.getParentLayer()
		* Scene.toastLong and Scene.toastShort are helpers for showing Toast messages
		* Drawable.setZ, Drawable.getZ - for use with new DrawOrder.Z_ORDER
		* Drawable.getRotation()
		* MathHelper.pointInShape - determines whether a point is inside a Sprites shape/polygon
		* Preferences class, just a helper for SharedPreferences
		* Sprite.clearModifiers()
		* RokonActivity.setGameSize(width, height, force) Can force width/height to remain as given, setGameSize(width, height) now assumes fixed aspect and adjusts
		* Scene has a couple of abstract methods that must be overriden, onReady onResume onPause
		* Vibrator now has an enable() and disable(), to prevent the phone from being vibrated. The default state, is enabled
	
	Changes
		* DrawableObject.isOnScreen() returns FALSE if it is not added to a Layer
		* Modifier and some of its methods are now abstract (to force override). The parameters of onStart and onEnd changed
		* RokonActivity.getScene() is now static
		* RokonMusic is no longer automatically paused/resumed, this must be hanled manually (to allow transition between Activities)
	
	Bug Fixes
		* Drawable is now public, previously was not. This prevented 'onTouch(Drawable' methods from being used
		* Point.getY() returned wrong value if it had a parent
		* DrawableObjet.setSize did not modify height
		* TextSprite was being silly, and was looking for FontTexture intead of TextTexture
		* PhysicalSprite did not take into account current rotaton when creating its Body 
		* TextureAtlas was overlapping inserted Textures
		* Touchables are now checked against their rotated position, previously rotation wasn't considered
		* Fixed an issue with the Activity lifecycle, it should now properly reload textures / resume last position in the game when hidden / destroyed
		* Now works on the emulator, unsure where the bug was. Somewhere in this update!
		* Scene.pausePhysics() and Scene.resumePhysics() now work properly. Previously, it would cause unpredictable stuff in Box2D.
		* GameObject.isTouchable() would not take into consideration whether or not the object had been made invisible. Touchables must now be visible to be touched

30/06/10 - 2.0.2
	Another quick minor update, sorry for having so many packed together - obviously with the new release came a few unexpected bugs.
	The Droid/Milestone bug seems to have been fixed now.
	
	New Features
		* Vibrator class, for vibrating the device
		* Accelerometer and OnAccelerometerChange classes, for handling accelerometer changes and recognising device shakes
		* Scene.setClearColour changes glClearColor to your own values
		
	Changes
		* Default glClearColor is now black, instead of blue
		
	Bug Fixes
		* Fixed issue with Droid/Milestone. It seems they don't really support VBOs, and hackBrokenDevices wasn't picking that up
		* Texture paths would be incorrectly modified if RokonActivity.setGraphicsPath wasn't called

29/06/10 - 2.0.1
	A small update, released quickly, it seems the engine wasn't compatable with anything pre-2.2
	Should be fixed now, my bad!
	
	Bug Fixes
		* Compatability with pre-FroYo, it was a bug with how MotionEvent was used.
