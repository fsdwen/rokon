2.1.0
	New Features
		* The engine now uses a new multi-threaded system. Very similar (and partly stolen) from Replica Island. This introduces a lot more flexibility
			and some performance boosts (it was never a good idea to have everything in the UI thread, hehe). However you now need to be a bit more
			careful about handling your own threading issues. Hopefully I will bring in some helper stuff to simplify and reduce the coding. A tutorial
			on the new system, and techniques on using it properly, will be written prior to the release of 2.1.0
		* Time now has two timers, one for the game thread, (getLoopTicks) and one for the render thread (getDrawTicks)
		* Scene.onFadeEnd(DrawableObject)
		* Scene.onMoveEnd(DimensionalObject)
		* DimensionalObject.scaleFromCentre - scales from the centre point, speed (setSpeedX, setSpeedY) also affects this central point
		* Scene.onTouchCustom override and return true to implement your own touch handling routines (return true to ignore Rokon internals)
		
	Changes
		* The MotionEvent stuff has changed, again. An issue arose with using the threading system, and queuing up MotionEvents to be processed.
			When a second MotionEvent was added to the queue, Android uses the same MotionEvent object - so essentially destroys the first. This
			means holding on to MotionEvent's is pointless, and to prevent creating garbage, we're just using floats and ints and things again
			now. This might be a pain for some people who wanted to use the pressure stuff, but, this is for the greater good. I'm sure you'll
			be able to find a workaround if you really need that feature.
	
	Bug Fixes
		* Fixed bug with DrawableObject.fade

09/07/2010 2.0.3
	New Features
		* Drawable now has onTouch events within itself
		* DrawableObject.getParentLayer() fetches the current Layer
		* Scene.toastLong and Scene.toastShort are helpers for showing Toast messages
		* Drawable.setZ, Drawable.getZ - for use with new DrawOrder.Z_ORDER
		* Drawable.getRotation() fetches rotation, forces override
		* MathHelper.pointInShape - determines whether a point is inside a Sprites shape/polygon
		* Preferences class, just a helper for SharedPreferences
		* Sprite.clearModifiers() clears all current modifiers
		* RokonActivity.setGameSize(width, height, force) Can force width/height to remain as given, setGameSize(width, height) now assumes fixed aspect and adjusts
		* Scene has a couple of abstract methods that must be overriden, onReady onResume onPause
		* Vibrator now has an enable() and disable(), to prevent the phone from being vibrated. The default state, is enabled
		* Functionality to load inside a RelativeLayout - to enable a top layer of Views, createEngine(true), then getInterface() for the top RelativeLayout
		* Sprite.intersects(Sprite) is a helper to the MathHelper function of the same description
		* Automatically disables VBOs on emulator, they are not supported
		* Rokon.circle is now a Polygon, but when checked for touch events, will behave as a circle
		* DrawableObject.stopFade() stops any current fading animations
		* ColourBuffer class and DrawableObject.setColourBuffer - allows colour-by-vertex mode. This isn't stable yet, seems to have some bugs, please don't report them.
	
	Changes
		* DrawableObject.isOnScreen() returns FALSE if it is not added to a Layer
		* Modifier and some of its methods are now abstract (to force override). The parameters of onStart and onEnd changed
		* RokonActivity.getScene() is now static
		* RokonMusic is no longer automatically paused/resumed, this must be hanled manually (to allow transition between Activities).
		* Scene onTouch methods now pass pointerCount parameter, this is to negate the need for your own wrappers to check if getPointerCount() is available
	
	Bug Fixes
		* Drawable is now public, previously was not. This prevented 'onTouch(Drawable' methods from being used
		* Point.getY() returned wrong value if it had a parent
		* DrawableObjet.setSize did not modify height
		* TextSprite was being silly, and was looking for FontTexture intead of TextTexture
		* TextSprite NullPointerException fixed when no text given and drawing in PRIORITY_NORMAL
		* PhysicalSprite did not take into account current rotaton when creating its Body 
		* TextureAtlas was overlapping inserted Textures
		* Touchables are now checked against their rotated position, previously rotation wasn't considered
		* Fixed an issue with the Activity lifecycle, it should now properly reload textures / resume last position in the game when hidden / destroyed
		* Now works on the emulator, unsure where the bug was. Somewhere in this update!
		* Scene.pausePhysics() and Scene.resumePhysics() now work properly. Previously, it would cause unpredictable stuff in Box2D.
		* GameObject.isTouchable() would not take into consideration whether or not the object had been made invisible. Touchables must now be visible to be touched
		* Fixed DimensionalObject.move() over-time functions. Would appear to do nothing if only passing X, Y coordinates
		* Fixed NullPointerException in TextSprite when added to Scene without calling setText first
		* DrawableObject.forceDrawObject wrongly determined VBO support
		* Fixed DrawableObject.fade, would not fade from high to low properly
		* RokonMusic would not reset properly, causing immediate System.exit()

30/06/10 - 2.0.2
	Another quick minor update, sorry for having so many packed together - obviously with the new release came a few unexpected bugs.
	The Droid/Milestone bug seems to have been fixed now.
	
	New Features
		* Vibrator class, for vibrating the device
		* Accelerometer and OnAccelerometerChange classes, for handling accelerometer changes and recognising device shakes
		* Scene.setClearColour changes glClearColor to your own values
		
	Changes
		* Default glClearColor is now black, instead of blue
		
	Bug Fixes
		* Fixed issue with Droid/Milestone. It seems they don't really support VBOs, and hackBrokenDevices wasn't picking that up
		* Texture paths would be incorrectly modified if RokonActivity.setGraphicsPath wasn't called

29/06/10 - 2.0.1
	A small update, released quickly, it seems the engine wasn't compatable with anything pre-2.2
	Should be fixed now, my bad!
	
	Bug Fixes
		* Compatability with pre-FroYo, it was a bug with how MotionEvent was used.

29/06/10 - 2.0.0
	Initial release of Rokon 2.0.0
