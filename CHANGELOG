1.1.2
	Overview
	
	New Features
	
	Changes
	
	Bug Fixes
		* Fixed onExit() bug not being called in Menu

1.1.1 - 2/1/2010
	Overview
		* Far better touch recognition, no more stupid timed usage
	
	New Features
		* Shape class allows geometric shapes to be drawn and manipulated as DynamicObjects, based on Polygons
		* Particle systems are now ready for us, see Example16
	
	Changes
		* Hotspot is now bound to DynamicObject rather than Sprite
	
	Bug Fixes
		* NullPointerException check on sensorManager 
		* Continuous playback in RokonMusic is fixed
		* Fixed loading screen problems
		* DynamicObject acceleration bug

1.1.0 - 29/12/2009
	Overview
		* An overhaul of the way textures are handled, see the Texture tutorial for help on updating your code http://stickycoding.com/rokon/rokon-tutorials/managing-textures
		* Now targets 1.6 SDK, uses direct buffers
	
	New Features
		* Basic and Advanced Menu examples added, see Example13 and Example14
		* Handling the accelerometer can be done through RokonActivity, see Example15
		* New, far more advanced particle engine, see Example16
		* Custom Tile Animation method for Sprite, see Example17
		* Added a very primitive post-processing demonstration, see Example18
		* ParallaxBackground is capable of horizontal parallax scrolling, see Example19
		
	Changes
		* Removed Emitter package, functionality replaced by ParticleModifier's
		* Documentation added to previous examples
		* Sprite, Particle, Emitter all now extend the superclass DynamicObject - in an attempt to the dynamics' functions
		* InputHandler works with XY coordinates directly, instead of the MotionEvent object
		* Font is now an extension of Texture, and must be applied to the atlas in the same way to be visible
	
	Bug Fixes
		* Texture loading error, 'width and height > 0' has been fixed - it was due to variables not being reset properly when the engine is created
		* Width/Height of screen is returned properly, so runs correctly on Droid
		* Touches are now recognised correctly at higher screen resolutions
		* TTF Font integration works, Example8 has been modified

1.0.2 - 19/12/2009
	Overview
		* Reworked OpenGL classes
		* Game menu system working
		
	New Features
		* Menu, MenuObject
		
	Changes
		* A new GLSurfaceView/GLRenderer improves speed and touch accuracy
		* Package name changed from rokon to com.stickycoding.rokon
		* Method of handling screen sizes optimized
		* Texture loading has changed, textures are placed on the hardware through texSubImage2D one by one, instead of copying the whole atlas over. This is instead of storing all the bitmaps in the memory for the whole game. 
		
	Bug Fixes
		* A bug in TextureAtlas causing the engine to crash when preparing an atlas
		
1.0.1 - 29/11/2009
 	Overview
 		* Texture handling has been greatly improved, quicker to load, more control over its content - the texture can be changed after it has already been loaded
 		* The engine will automatically crop to the correct aspect ratio on larger screens
 		* The loading screen now scales any sized image to any sized screen, and appears quicker
 		
 	New Features
 		* Rokon.forceLetterBox() will remove all objects outside of the desired aspect ratio, this will be automatically set to true if the aspect ratio of the device is not what you provide
		* Rokon.forceTextureRefresh() will force the engine to use a new atlas configuration each time, this should be on when building, and removed for your published version
 		* Texture.replace(Bitmap/String) copies an image onto the texture, and replaces it on the hardware. The replacement bitmap must have the same dimensions as the original.
 		* Rokon.freezeUntilTexturesReloaded() will freeze the screen until new textures (Texture.replace) have been loaded onto the engine
 		* Hotspot's can now be set IDs for easier recognition, setId() getId() and a new constructors - Hotspot(x, y, width, height, id) and Hotspot(sprite, id)
 		* InputHandler.onHotspotTouched(Hotspot, MotionEvent) will now be called after onHotspotTouched(Hotspot), it passes on touch coordinates. Both will be called, you should only handle one or the other.
 		* READ_PHONE_STATE was added to AndroidManifest.xml
 		
 	Changes
 		* TextureAtlas methods and variables are now static
 		* TextureAtlas will store its previous configuration, it will force a new configuration if there are new files. This increases loading time significantly.
 		* Texture.getBitmap() fetches the texture bitmap from the atlas after it has been loaded
 		* Off-screen sprites are no longer rendered, to speed up drawing time (Rokon.forceOffscreenRender() removes this check)

1.0.0 - 28/11/2009
	New Features
		* RokonActivity is now the preferred way of using the engine
		* Loading screens
 
	Changes
		* TextureAtlas supports multiple textures on the hardware
		* Engine is created with a fixed size, and scaled to all screen sizes
