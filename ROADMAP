This is a very simple roadmap, I have laid out the features I would like the engine to have in the order I would like to get them done. Because of my situation, I can in no way put a deadline or times to these, or even promise the order will be kept to. But hopefully this will help us steer ourselves in the right direction.

 * Multiple ways of handling different screen resolutions
 * An advanced menu system, for in and out-of-game menu's - including many View-like objects (lists, option boxes)
 * Tiled game engine
 * Advanced Particle Engine
 * Polygon-based collision detection
 * Post processing & z-order effects
 * Integrated physics, potentially through NDK
 
Below are some features that are not necessarily features of the engine in the state it's at now, but things that I want to get done.
 * Complete examples for all important features of the engine
 * Tutorials for important features
 * Regularly updated and comprehensive wiki
 * Extended game frameworks/templates (rather than a graphics engine) for various genres
 * Lobby-based multiplayer framework
 * Advanced online highscore tracker
 * Remote error logging
 
It is also my goal to release several (very basic) open source games based on Rokon, that should help people along their way.
