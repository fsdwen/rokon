This is simply a list of future features, for future versions. There can be no times associated to these.
Rokon 2 is intended to be more of a game engine than a graphics engine (as is the original version)

Efficient audio engine
Basic collision engine
Advanced collision/physics engine
Game windows inside scenes
Automatic support for VBOs and DrawTex
Supporting various methods of texture loading (atlases, separate textures)
Modifying textures at runtime, quickly
Intuitive 'scripting' and callbacks, rather than handlers
Tile engine (graphical)
Tile based movement
Some basic/generic AI that can be applied to many situations (path finding etc.)

Above all, a good balance between ease/speed of use and high framerates must be maintained
